📊 Datasets
1️⃣ Algerian_forest_fires_dataset_CLEANED.csv - Cleaned version of the Algerian forest fires dataset.
2️⃣ Algerian_forest_fires_dataset_UPDATE.csv - Updated version with additional features or corrections.
3️⃣ Fire_dataset_cleaned.csv - Another cleaned dataset used for model training.

📜 Notebooks
📌 Wild_Fire Part-1 EDA.ipynb - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand fire occurrence patterns.
📌 Wild_Fire Part-2 Model.ipynb - Model building for wildfire classification and regression.

🧠 Machine Learning Models
✅ classification.pkl - Trained model for wildfire classification (fire/no fire).
✅ regression.pkl - Trained model for wildfire intensity prediction.

⚙️ Dependencies
📌 requirements.txt - List of required Python libraries.

To install dependencies, run:
pip install -r requirements.txt

2️⃣ Run Exploratory Data Analysis
Open and run Wild_Fire Part-1 EDA.ipynb to analyze the dataset.

3️⃣ Train or Use the Models
To retrain the models, run Wild_Fire Part-2 Model.ipynb.
To use the trained models, load classification.pkl and regression.pkl in your Python script.

📊 Results
✔ Classification model - Predicts wildfire occurrence.
✔ Regression model - Predicts wildfire intensity based on weather and vegetation conditions.
